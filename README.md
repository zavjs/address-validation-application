# Address App

Welcome to the [Address App](http://address-app.zavareze.com.br/). This app is built in two main sections: 

**[Home](http://address-app.zavareze.com.br/)** is the place where you can register new addresses. Follow through the form instructions and if provided with enough information, the address validation API will offer a recommendation. 

- The address validation API is a proxy in the PHP server to prevent exposing api credentials. 

**Note**: there's plenty of opportunity for improvement, but the main focus is functionality and good security practices given the limited time invested.

**[Addresses List](http://address-app.zavareze.com.br/list)**, which is where you see the list of previously saved addresses.

## Seeing it live

For this application to work locally you will need to have an .env file with a series of api credentials and database variables that are hidden outside of the scope of this public repository.
