# Address App

Welcome to the Address Validator.

### The App

The app is divided in two sections:

**Home** is the place where you can register new addresses. Follow through the form instructions and if provided with enough information, the address validation API will offer a recommendation. 

- The address validation API is a proxy in the PHP server to prevent exposing api credentials. 

**Addresses List**, which is where you see the list of previously saved addresses.
